#### By _**{Alex Altieri}**_

## Description

_{User will enter a word they want to count in an input field, and then create a list of words in the second input field to count through. After submitting, another page will tell the user how many times the target word appears in the list.}_

## Setup

* _Clone github repository_
* _Install required gems_
* _Get Sinatra running_
* _Open the app in your web browser_
* _Start Counting!!!_

_{Make sure you have those gems! This app won't run without Sinatra and will be a pain without Sinatra-contrib. If you don't want to do that, follow this Heroku link: https://mighty-springs-2613.herokuapp.com/}_
